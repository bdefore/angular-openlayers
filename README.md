angular-openlayers
==================

An example Angular.JS app using OpenLayers.

## Getting Started
==================

This example app was built with a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)-generated CoffeeScript application and Node.JS 0.10.21.

To test locally, install Node and run: 

```shell
npm install -g grunt
npm install
bower install
grunt server
```

This should automatically direct your browser to:

http://127.0.0.1:9000/#/from_coords_in_template

Other routes include:

http://127.0.0.1:9000/#/from_name

http://127.0.0.1:9000/#/from_url?lat=42.68875914122395&lon=17.689577342419913&zoom=5
